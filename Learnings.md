- Ensure that
    - Array index is within bounds before accessing the element.
    - Dictionary key is present before accessing the value.
    - Initial values of variables are correct in `for` statement.

- Remember to
    - Read and understand the problem statement carefully.
    - Initalize complex variables like dictionaries.
    - Update the loop variable values.
    - Set correct visibility on methods and classes.
    - Take modulus of answer if the problem mentions it.
    - Enqueue number in heap before dequeuing the one it replaces.
    - Include sorting time when calculating time complexity.
    - Compose numbers in correct direction (RTL or LTR).

- Look out for
    - Redundant loop conditions.
    - No matches, e.g., the first array item greater than the given integer.

- Keep in mind
    - Bitwise operators (`&`) have lower precedence than shift operators (`<<`).
    - Shift operators (`<<`) have lower precedence than arithmetic operators (`+`).
    - Initialize variable to `int.MinValue` not `0` if negative numbers are involved.
