This is my attempt to annotate the problems based on the kind of solution they require. This should help me with
filtering and picking the right ones at a later time for revising.

List of annotations:

- **Difficulty** - Difficulty level of the problem.
- **Quality** - How elegant the solution that is required is.
- **Important** - Should the problem be considered when quickly glossing over.
