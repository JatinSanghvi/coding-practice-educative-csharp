// Minimize Malware Spread
// =======================
//
// You're given a network of n nodes as an n×n adjacency matrix graph with the ith node directly connected to the jth
// node if `graph[i][j] == 1`.
//
// A list of nodes, `initial`, is given, which contains nodes initially infected by malware. When two nodes are
// connected directly and at least one of them is infected by malware, both nodes will be infected by malware. This
// spread of malware will continue until every node in the connected component of nodes has been infected.
//
// After the infection has stopped spreading, M will represent the final number of nodes in the entire network that have
// been infected with malware.
//
// Return a node from `initial` such that, when this node is removed from the graph, M is minimized. If multiple nodes
// can be removed to minimize M, return the node with the smallest index.
//
// > Note: If a node was removed from the initial list of infected nodes, it might still be infected later on due to the
// > malware's spread.
//
// Constraints:
//
// - `graph.length` == `graph[i].length`
// - 2 ≤ n ≤ 50
// - `graph[i][j]` is 0 or 1.
// - `graph[i][j]` == `graph[j][i]`
// - `graph[i][i]` == 1
// - 1 ≤ `initial.length` ≤ n
// - 0 ≤ `initial[i]` ≤ n - 1
// - All the integers in the `initial` are unique.
